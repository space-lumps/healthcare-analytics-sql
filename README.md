# Healthcare Analytics: Clinical Cohort Construction in SQL

### Overview

This repository implements a **reproducible analytics-engineering workflow** for healthcare encounter data using SQL. The project focuses on constructing a clinically meaningful cohort, deriving encounter-level metrics, and validating results with explicit QA tests.

The end result is an **analysis-ready cohort table** at a clear grain (`patient_id + encounter_id`) that can be safely used downstream for reporting, modeling, or further analysis.

---

### Objective

* Define a drug overdose hospital encounter cohort using explicit clinical and demographic criteria
* Engineer encounter-level features commonly used in healthcare analytics
* Validate complex logic (e.g., readmissions, age calculation) with standalone test queries
* Demonstrate production-style SQL organization, normalization, and quality checks

---

### Cohort Definition

The cohort includes hospital encounters that meet all of the following:

* `encounters.reasondescription = 'Drug overdose'`
* Encounter start date after **1999-07-15**
* Patient age at encounter between **18 and 35** (inclusive, birthday-accurate calculation)

The cohort is built as a **TEMP VIEW** to support iterative analysis and validation.

---

### Metrics & Features Produced

Each row represents **one patient encounter** and includes:

* `death_at_visit_ind`  
  Indicator for death occurring during the encounter window

* `count_current_meds`  
  Count of medications active at encounter start

* `current_opioid_ind`  
  Indicator for active opioid medications at encounter start

* `readmission_90_day_ind`  
  Indicator for overdose readmission within 90 days

* `readmission_30_day_ind`  
  Indicator for overdose readmission within 30 days

* `first_readmission_date`  
  Date of first qualifying readmission, if any

All metrics are derived explicitly in SQL with documented assumptions and tested constraints.

---

### Validation & QA

The repo includes **dedicated validation queries** to verify correctness of key logic, including:

* Independent recalculation of readmission indicators  
* Comparison of age calculation methods (year-diff vs birthday-accurate)  
* Validation that readmission counts are unaffected by cohort-side age filtering  
* Duplicate grain checks (`patient_id + encounter_id`)  
* Source reconciliation and join fanout checks  
* Null and range validation tests  

Key validated findings include:

* `encounters.id` is unique (no encounter-level deduplication required)
* `encounters.stop` contains no null values (validated during QA)
* Expanding readmission logic beyond the age-filtered cohort produced identical results in the prod and sample dataset
* Medication deduplication was required and handled during normalization

Validation logic lives alongside the pipeline and can be run independently.
Validation summary is documented in `docs/validation_summary`
* tests with prefix including "src_recon" are designed to recalculate cohort-selection calculations before further schema tests.

### How to Run

* SQL engine: **DuckDB**
* DuckDB must be started from `sql/pipeline/` for relative paths to resolve correctly
* Scripts are numbered and must be run in order
* `10_normalize_sources.sql` must be executed before `20_build_cohort.sql`, followed by `30_output_csv.sql`
* Validation tests can be run after the cohort TEMP VIEW is created

Detailed environment setup and execution instructions are documented in `docs/run_instructions.md`.

### Data

Raw source files are not committed to this repository. The project separates local production inputs from reproducible sample data:

- `datasets/prod/`  
  Local, production-scale source files (gitignored).

- `datasets/sample/`  
  Synthetic sample CSVs included to make the pipeline runnable and to exercise key edge cases.

Notes:
- Raw encounter timestamps are stored as UTC in the source data and are converted to `DATE` during normalization for consistent downstream comparisons.
- The pipeline operates on normalized DuckDB TEMP VIEWs generated by `10_normalize_sources.sql`.
- Tested constraints, assumptions, and validation findings are documented in `/docs`.
- Switch between `datasets/sample/` and `datasets/prod/` by updating the `config` TEMP VIEW at the top of `10_normalize_sources.sql`.

### Notes

This project follows analytics engineering principles:

* Explicit grain definition  
* Deterministic business logic  
* Separation of normalization and feature engineering  
* Independent QA validation  
* Documented assumptions and tested constraints  

The workflow mirrors patterns used in healthcare analytics and production SQL pipelines.
